abstract="The Smodels system is an Answer Set Programming (ASP) implementation based on the stable model semantics of normal logic programs. The basic idea of ASP is to encode the constraints of a problem as a logic program such that the answer sets (stable models) of the program correspond to the solutions of the problem. Then we can solve the problem by letting a logic program engine to find the answer sets of the program.",

pages="3--35",
abstract="This paper introduces a novel logical framework for concept-learning called brave induction. Brave induction uses brave inference for induction and is useful for learning from incomplete information. Brave induction is weaker than explanatory induction which is normally used in inductive logic programming, and is stronger than learning from satisfiability, a general setting of concept-learning in clausal logic. We first investigate formal properties of brave induction, then develop an algorithm for computing hypotheses in full clausal theories. Next we extend the framework to induction in nonmonotonic logic programs. We analyze computational complexity of decision problems for induction on propositional theories. Further, we provide examples of problem solving by brave induction in systems biology, requirement engineering, and multiagent negotiation.",
