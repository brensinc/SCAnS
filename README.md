# SCAnS Matlab to Python Translation

This repository originally contained MATLAB scripts for the SCAnS project.
A helper script `matlab_to_python.py` has been added to produce a rough
Python translation. Running the script creates a `python_version/` directory
mirroring the MATLAB file structure with `.py` files.

The translation is automatic and may not be fully functional. Manual review
and adjustment are recommended before use.
