# SCAnS (Stochastic Contract-based Analysis and Synthesis)

SCAnS (Stochastic Contract-based Analysis and Synthesis) is a MATLAB toolbox for contract-based analysis and synthesis of systems under probabilistic requirements.

SCAnS implements the verification and synthesis procedures described in the paper **"Stochastic Contracts for Cyber-Physical System Design Under Probabilistic Requirements"** by Jiwei Li, Pierluigi Nuzzo, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, Yugeng Xi, and Dewei Li, in *Proc. Int. Conf. Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE)*, 2017,p. 5-14. See also the arXiv version (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09316).

## Software Installation
To install SCAnS you can clone or download the SCAnS repository. Installation of MATLAB, GUROBI, and YALMIP are also necessary.

### GUROBI Installation
GUROBI is a solver for mathematical programming. SCAnS uses GUROBI to solve mixed integer linear programs (MILP).
1. [Download and install GUROBI](http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer)
2. [Setup GUROBI for MATLAB](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/quickstart_mac/matlab_setting_up_gurobi_f.html)

### YALMIP Installation
YALMIP is a MATLAB toolbox for optimization modeling. YALMIP is compatible with GUROBI.   
1. [Download YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/download/)
2. [Add YALMIP directories to MATLAB path](https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/installation/)
